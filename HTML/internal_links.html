      clean user interface? While most of us would reply with an assertive
      ‘YES,’ little, do we know the kind of effort and skill that goes into
      making a website attractive and user-friendly. The secret to creating an
      impressive site is to master the art of front-end development, and no, it
      is not as easy as it seems!
    </p>

      However, it is not impossible either. Here are five tips that’ll help you
      get better in front-end design and web development.

        <h3>Commenting</h3>
        <p>Commenting is one such practice that is often ignored by programmers, especially for codes that are written
          by
          multiple programmers. But remember, commenting is an important part of project you create. With proper
          comments
          and organised files its always easier for you or others to jump in and understand where things are at and how
          they work.

        <h3>Invest in Productive Tools</h3>
        <p>The Internet is teeming with a host of web development tools, from browser add-ons to smart plugins, the
          amount
          of choices available now is massive! So, why not invest in some really productive web tools that’ll help you
          improve your front-end designing skills? Tools like Sublime Text, jQuery, Emmet, Bootstrap, and Sass are
          nothing
          short of a godsend for web developers.

        <h3>Always Be Curious</h3>
        <p>A front-end developer has to keep himself/herself updated continuously with the latest news and innovations
          in
          the field. You need to take a proactive stand and learn new things about front-end development from
          informative
          blogs and videos. Following are some of the most informative and useful learning sources for front-end
          developers -

        <h3>Refractor Your Code From Time To Time</h3>
        <p>By “refactoring” your code, you’re only enhancing the code without tampering with its functionality. This
          will improve the quality and readability quotient of your code and the more often you do it, your code will
          continually be updated into a cleaner and fresher version of what it was before. Apart from that, one of the
          most significant advantages that refactoring offers is that it ensures your code remains free from plagiarism.
