          <h4>Commenting</h4>
          <p>
            Commenting is one such practice that is often ignored by
            programmers, especially for codes that are written by multiple
            programmers. But remember, commenting is an important part of
            project you create. With proper comments and organised files its
            always easier for you or others to jump in and understand where
            things are at and how they work.
